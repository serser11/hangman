# Introduction

Just like the hangman game that we've played in childhood, you will have 6 lifes to guess
the phrase shown in "-" (here the phrase should be a place in UC Berkeley).

If the character appears at least once in the phrase, all the occurence of the character 
in the phrase will be revealed.

Every time you enter a character that's not contained in the phrase, you lose one life
and the hangman is one more step towards death (shown in the screenshot in this folder).

If you guess correctly before the hangman dies, you will get a winning alert saying "Start Over".
You can also choose to start over (top right button) or exit game (top left button) during the game.
